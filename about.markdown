Hello and Welcome to the Rankin Bacon Blog.

My name is Tyler Rankin whose name rhymes with bacon.

I've been a nerd my whole life, my first video game console being the N64 when I was just four years old.

As I've grown my interest as a nerd has grown with me; teaching myself programming and getting an awesome job
at a tech consultation company called Coforge.

The reason why I love being a nerd is because it always forces me to always use my brain everyday no matter what
I'm consuming. And that's what this blog is all about, just another hobby for me to express the joys of my simple
passions.

The content can include my opinions about video games, movies or books.
Or when I get around to it, I'd like to cover programming tutorials.
Or who knows what else, this is my blog after all so I could get away with talking about life events as well. (Don't worry I'll leave out the hot gossip so it's doesn't feel like an episode of Orange County)

So pretty much the main point of the website is to be chill. So grab your favorite cup of tea, coffee or... water and I hope you enjoy
whatever I decide to write about.
