I have very fond memories of the old Luigi’s Mansion back when it was released on the Gamecube. As everyone knows Luigi played very small roles in other Mario games. Making an appearance in the arcade game Mario Bros and Super Mario Bros 2. He did star in his own game back in the SNES era but we don’t talk about that one too much.

So me in my younger years being uneducated about gaming lore had no idea Mario even had a brother. I just remember buying my parent’s buying our family’s first GameCube and getting a copy of Luigi’s Mansion and I remember thinking “Who is this guy?” Little did I know that I was playing one of Nintendo’s most unique and charming games to that date. I loved the simple Metroidvania sense of progression that really made the Mansion a character all on its own. More importantly it established how Luigi can go it alone without his brother Mario.  I could honestly make a whole blog post about the original Luigi’s Mansion but today I’m writing about Luigi’s Mansion 3.

Truth be told, I never did play the previous entry in this franchise Luigi’s Mansion 2. (Or Dark Moon, who cares.) Personally, I was never the biggest fan of the 3DS which was during the time I kinda had a axe to grind with Nintendo because I just wasn’t personally satisfied with their products at the time. (The Wii U era, enough said) All I know about it is that my little brother played it and he thought it was meh. That’s about it. So I can’t compare the differences between LM 3 and LM 2.

So how does Luigi’s Mansion 3 compare to the original then. While I would say it’s not quite cigar, it is still pretty close.

# Gameplay

It was honestly so nice to equip the Poltergust again. Capturing ghosts with this beastly vacuum is the main draw for the franchise. The controls are very simple, you charge your flashlight that when release will blast ghost with a beam of light. This will freeze the ghost giving you the opportunity to suck it into your vacuum. The ghost will try to escape so you gotta pay attention to how the ghost flies around so you don’t get thrown off your feet. Plus, in later stages you need to pay attention to what other ghost are doing in case they attempt to attack you while your working to capture one of their ghost buddies. However, in this entry Luigi has built up some muscles! With the push of the A button you can swing the ghost around the arena allowing you to smack other ghost with the ghost you’re capturing. The only disadvantage to this move is that if the ghost still has HP left it will instantly release them. The timings and struggles in combat were a lot of fun! It’s seriously hard to believe whether or not this mechanic could ever get old. 

Well okay there is only one downside to the Poltergust gameplay. The normal combat encounters just felt too easy. Sometimes I felt like combat encounters would end before they got exciting. Sure, when I encountered a new enemy type it gave me some pause. Good on the designers for looking for ways to mix things throughout the game. However, a part of me wondered what this game would feel like if my vacuum didn’t quite do so much damage or if the ghost had more than 100 HP. Or if there were more ghosts trying to attack you per combat encounter. While I’ll dive further into the traditional linear level design approach Nintendo took with this game, I felt like they could have leveraged this more to make the combat encounters more difficult. Besides that I felt like the ghost capturing was great in this game.

The game also features are mode called the Scarescraper, which is the multiplayer for Luigi’s Mansion 3. However, I personally never got into it.



# Bosses

I have many fond memories from the original Luigi’s Mansion of the iconic ghost bosses you could capture in that entry. The bosses you’ll encounter in Luigi’s Mansion 3 met that iconic standard. However, one aspect where the successor exceeded the original was in the build up for these bosses. In the original, I remember simply stumbling upon the boss ghosts in the game. Each one would offer a puzzle stylized to their characteristics that once solved would reward with the opportunity to capture the ghost. Of course, this was fun, however, I think it can be said that your relationship with these ghost were short lived.

In Luigi’s Mansion 3, you were usually introduced to the boss close to the beginning of the level. Each of these bosses were trusted with an elevator button that Luigi needs in order to reach new floors. Each of these floors are usually themed after the boss as well. For example, the Castle themed level will have a ghost who dresses up like a king. For the levels that understand this formula very well, it helps build a relationship between you and the boss. Creating a chain of events that builds up the suspense for that final crescendo. 


# Level Design

So this is the part of the Luigi’s Mansion 3 started charging forward from being good to great in my eyes. The first few floors are pretty standard normal affairs. We’re marching through this hotel, we’re capturing the ghost and I was starting to get a bit tired of the corridor like level design. There were small pockets in each of these areas you could discover but it wasn’t quite scratching that itch for me. The environments started to feel repetitive and I was worried the game would just continue with small deviations of this pattern. 

However, once I hit the sixth floor I was stunned about the sudden transition we made from these samy looking hotel floors to a floor completely themed after a medieval castle. The level was decked out with creepy looking knight statues, a moat, a jousting arena, torture devices and more!

The level was so much fun that I began to hope that they would keep pushing those kind of themed levels throughout the game. I’m happy to also say that hope was not left unfulfilled. From the sixth floor on, each floor was a treat  that got my exploration vibes pumping.

The big downside that I will callout though is that some of the levels felt so short that it came across as cheap to me. If you were to literally draw the shape of an L on a piece of paper that would literally be the layout for that level. These levels are so linear that they tend to bypass that one advantage I mentioned earlier by building a relationship with the boss ghost for that level. Instead, these types of floors are more like highly themed boss levels. The bosses were still good, but the pacing just felt way too fast in those levels. In particular, the pirate looked like it could have had so much opportunity! There was a cave, a beach and a giant pirate ship! No spoilers but the boss for that level was also spectacular. Easily one of my favorite boss fights in the game. It was just really unfortunate that the level was so short because I feel I would have had a great time capturing more pirate themed ghosts. 

# Final Thoughts

You know, I could honestly spend too much time writing about this game. With this single blog post, coming close to about 1300 words. To put that in perspective, that would have met the requirements my english professors would have expected out of me. Are there bad spots in this game, sure. However, I would be remiss if I never recommended this game to my friends. In the end, Luigi’s Mansion 3 gave me an adventure that lasted me about 10 hours. If I’m in the mood for a little rest, I won’t mind checking in to Luigi’s Mansion.
