 Hello World!

 I guess that I'm full speed ahead on this whole blog thing.
 One of the things I would love to write about on a consistent basis would be coding tutorials! I've been very lucky to have taught myself enough code in order to land a career in the tech industry. So it'd be nice to share what I've learned along the way.

 Therefore, why not cover the absolute basics that I'm positive any developer whose visiting this blog has probably seen before!

 Today we're going to discuss how to use radio buttons!

I don't care if you can google it and find it on MDN. 
We're doing it anyway dang it!

# Making a Radio Button

The code for this very humble input is as follows.


    <input type="radio" id="yes" name="cheese" value="yes"> 
    <label for="yes">Yes</label>  
    <input type="radio" id="no" name="cheese" value="no"> 
    <label for="no">No</label>


It produces the following result!
<br>
<div>
    <input type="radio" id="yes" name="cheese" value="yes"> 
    <label for="yes">Yes</label>  
    <input type="radio" id="no" name="cheese" value="no"> 
    <label for="no">No</label>
</div>
