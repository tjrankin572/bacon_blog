I"Û<p>Hello World!</p>

<p>I guess that Iâ€™m full speed ahead on this whole blog thing.
 One of the things I would love to write about on a consistent basis would be coding tutorials! Iâ€™ve been very lucky to have taught myself enough code in order to land a career in the tech industry. So itâ€™d be nice to share what Iâ€™ve learned along the way.</p>

<p>Therefore, why not cover the absolute basics that Iâ€™m positive any developer whose visiting this blog has probably seen before!</p>

<p>Today weâ€™re going to discuss how to use radio buttons!</p>

<p>I donâ€™t care if you can google it and find it on MDN. 
Weâ€™re doing it anyway dang it!</p>

<h1 id="making-a-radio-button">Making a Radio Button</h1>

<p>The code for this very humble input is as follows.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;input type="radio" id="yes" name="cheese" value="yes"&gt; 
&lt;label for="yes"&gt;Yes&lt;/label&gt;  
&lt;input type="radio" id="no" name="cheese" value="no"&gt; 
&lt;label for="no"&gt;No&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It produces the following result!
<br /></p>
<div>
    <input type="radio" id="yes" name="cheese" value="yes" /> 
    <label for="yes">Yes</label>  
    <input type="radio" id="no" name="cheese" value="no" /> 
    <label for="no">No</label>
</div>
