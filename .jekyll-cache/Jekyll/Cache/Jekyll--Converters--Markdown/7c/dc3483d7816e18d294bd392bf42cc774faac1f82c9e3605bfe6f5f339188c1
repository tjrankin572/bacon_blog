I"¥<p>Hello and Welcome to the Rankin Bacon Blog.</p>

<p>My name is Tyler Rankin whose name rhymes with bacon.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been a nerd my whole life, my first video game console being the N64 when I was just four years old.</p>

<p>As Iâ€™ve grown my interest as a nerd has grown with me; teaching myself programming and getting an awesome job
at a tech consultation company called Coforge.</p>

<p>The reason why I love being a nerd is because it always forces me to always use my brain everyday no matter what
Iâ€™m consuming. And thatâ€™s what this blog is all about, just another hobby for me to express the joys of my simple
passions.</p>

<p>The content can include my opinions about video games, movies or books.
Or when I get around to it, Iâ€™d like to cover programming tutorials.
Or who knows what else, this is my blog after all so I could get away with talking about life events as well. (Donâ€™t worry Iâ€™ll leave out the hot gossip so itâ€™s doesnâ€™t feel like an episode of Orange County)</p>

<p>So pretty much the main point of the website is to be chill. So grab your favorite cup of tea, coffee orâ€¦ water and I hope you enjoy
whatever I decide to write about.</p>
